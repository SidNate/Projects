Problem Statement :


IMP Concepts to add: REVPAR (Rev avai per room)
                     Formula: Total Reve/ Total rooms avai to sale
                     ADR * occupancy also gives REVPAR

                     Occupancy % = Total room occupied/ Total room avai
                     ADR (Avg daily rate)
                     Formula ADR = /Total rooms revenue / num of rooms sold
 
                     SRS (Sellable Room nights) , evaluated daily so also called DSRS (daily sella room nights)

                     Concepts related to realization: 
                       1 Utilised Room nights:
                       2 booked room nights
                     Realisation = URN/BRN
                         BRN = URN + No shows + Cancellations  
                         
                     Add filters like weekends(fri,sat not sat,sun) vs weekdays 
                     Try to shows Trends: Weekly and Monthly
                     Show Channel Level Split: Which channels and how much they contribute to the bookings

                     Level ! and Level 2 Analysis:
                     1: Whether problem is there or not 2: Where is the problem exactly
